# The Relationships of Resting-state Brain Entropy (BEN), Ovarian Hormones and Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems (BIS/BAS)


This project investigated the relationships among resting-state brain entropy (BEN), ovarian hormones, and the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems (BIS/BAS). Our key findings are as follows:

1. Progesterone (PROG) demonstrated a significant negative correlation with brain entropy (BEN) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

2. Impulsivity, as assessed by the BAS-drive subscale of the Behavioral Activation System (BAS), showed negative correlations with both PROG levels and BEN in the left DLPFC.

3. The inhibitory effect of PROG on impulsivity appears to be mediated through the enhancement of executive control functions. This neuroregulatory mechanism is achieved by improving temporal coherence (reflected by lower BEN) of neural activity, thereby facilitating temporal synchronization (indicated by higher functional connectivity) within the left DLPFC.


The manuscript of this project is currently undergoing peer review, and the revised version has been resubmitted for further evaluation. 


Regarding data accessibility, we have made all project files publicly available on the Open Science Framework (OSF). However, an unexpected issue arose when I attempted to edit the project description in detail from another project, my account was abruptly suspended without prior notice or apparent justification. The suspension notification from email indicated that "your account on the Open Science Framework has been flagged as spam and disabled."

I am actively engaged in communications with OSF support to resolve this matter. Should the issue remain unresolved or the outcome prove unsatisfactory, I intend to discontinue utilizing this platform and will subsequently transfer all relevant research materials to GitHub for improved accessibility and long-term preservation.
