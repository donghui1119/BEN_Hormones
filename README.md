# The Relationships of Resting-state Brain Entropy (BEN), Ovarian Hormones and Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems (BIS/BAS)


This project investigated the relationships among resting-state brain entropy (BEN), ovarian hormones, and the Behavioral Inhibition and Activation Systems (BIS/BAS). Our key findings are as follows:

1. Progesterone (PROG) demonstrated a significant negative correlation with brain entropy (BEN) in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).

2. Impulsivity, as assessed by the BAS-drive subscale of the Behavioral Activation System (BAS), showed negative correlations with both PROG levels and BEN in the left DLPFC.

3. The inhibitory effect of PROG on impulsivity appears to be mediated through the enhancement of executive control functions. This neuroregulatory mechanism is achieved by improving temporal coherence (reflected by lower BEN) of neural activity, thereby facilitating temporal synchronization (indicated by higher functional connectivity) within the left DLPFC.


The manuscript of this project is currently undergoing peer review, and the revised version has been resubmitted for further evaluation. 


Considering reproducibility and to facilitate further investigations in related research areas, all project files will be publicly available on the Open Science Framework (OSF) upon publication of this work.
